```For the report and more info consult the project2_readme.pdf```

The following were implemented and compared (12 combinations in total):

# Initialization

1.Random selection of k points (simplest) 

2.K-means++  

# Assignment

1.Lloyd’s assignment

2.Assignment by Range search with LSH (εργασία 1)

3.Assignment by Range search with Hypercube (εργασία 1)

# Update

1.K-means

2.Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) improved like Lloyd’s
